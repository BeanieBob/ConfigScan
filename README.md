<b>ConfigScan</b>
<p>
 ConfigScan is a tool which allows .Net developers to check the validity of the connection strings in
 a config file. Brief test connections are made to each specified database to ensure that server addresses
 and credentials are correct. Connections are made asynchronously to minimize delay and a full list
 of connection statuses can be viewed after a test. For web config tests, inherited connections are
 included if appropriate. The tool should prove particularly useful for developers who work in 
 an environment where they are required to connect to multiple databases which are constantly being 
 migrated, and with credentials which expire frequently without adequate notice.
